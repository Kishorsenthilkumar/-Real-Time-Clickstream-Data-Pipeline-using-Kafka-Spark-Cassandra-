# Real-Time-Clickstream-Data-Pipeline-using-Kafka-Spark-Cassandra-
This project simulates and processes real-time clickstream data from an Amazon-like e-commerce website. Built as an end-to-end data engineering pipeline, it captures user interactions, processes them using Apache Spark, stores insights in Cassandra, and visualizes analytics in Tableau. The goal is to demonstrate scalable, real-time data processing

Steps To Implement :

1. install Hadoop,Spark,Kafka,Cassandra on your local machine
2. set the path in the environment variable (windows) and bashrc file (linux)
3. start hadoop,kafka,spark,cassandra via terminal
4. use docker for dependencies and version compatibility issues
5. write the code in your local machine and submit it to spark application
6. for clickstream data use dataset or make a clone of website like amazon to get clickstream data using flask(backend)
